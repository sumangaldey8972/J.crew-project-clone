        <p class="p">At J.Crew, we make timeless women’s clothing that lasts a lifetime, paired with of the-moment styles season
            after season, decade after decade. Need an example? Here are just a few... Our everyday cashmere sweaters
            are kind of a big deal, not only because they’re crazy soft, but because they’re also crazy affordable.
            Throw on a crewneck or V-neck with a pair of our standout jeans for women, which—if you haven’t heard—we’re
            also known for. Whether you prefer a skinny, straight, cropped, or boyfriend fit, we’re your definitive
            denim destination (say that three times fast). The finishing touch: outfit-making shoes for women that are
            as covetable as they are wear-all-day comfortable. Planning on getting out of town? We make women’s
            swimsuits in every color, print and style under the sun, which is why they’re the best in the biz. We hate
            to brag, but did we mention they’re also super flattering? (Okay, sorry, just the once.) Or maybe you’re
            office-bound for now. Fortunately, we’re devoted to designing women’s suits in as many refined fabrics and
            sleek silhouettes as there are minutes in your 9-to-5 or meetings in your calendar. And after you clock out,
            we still have you covered, from happy hour to weekend soirees—and even that super fancy wedding you’re
            invited to, thanks to our assortment of super pretty wedding guest dresses. But that’s just what we do. No
            big deal.</p>
